# Typography

CCV uses the University Theme sans-serif typeface Circular. 
There are two variations: Circular Book and Circular Bold. The monospace font uses the system font stack
which defaults to the system font of a particular operating system.
`<h>` html elements use Circular Bold, while `<p>` use Circular Book and `<code>`, of course, use monospace.
There's no need to set the font family yourself. 


Text elements inherit other variables (padding, margin, line-height, size, etc) from Bulma. 
Any text should be within a parent tag with the class `.content` for those variables to work.


Html text elements have their sizes set when its parent parent has the
`.content` class.
